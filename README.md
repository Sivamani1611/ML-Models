# ML-Models

This repository is dedicated to implementing various machine learning models from scratch using Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide educational resources and practical examples for understanding machine learning algorithms at a fundamental level, with a focus on gaining deeper insights into their mathematical foundations and practical usage.

## Repository Structure

Each model is organized into its own folder, which includes:

- **Python Script**: The implementation of the machine learning model.
- **README.md**: A detailed explanation of the model, its mathematical background, and sample outputs.

### Contents

1. **Linear Regression**
    - **Description**: Demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using gradient descent. Includes mathematical formulas and visualizations.
    - **Folder**: `LinearRegression`
    - **Documentation**: [Linear Regression README](./LinearRegression/README.md)

2. **Logistic Regression**
    - **Description**: Implements Logistic Regression for binary classification, including the sigmoid function and loss computation.
    - **Folder**: `LogisticRegression`
    - **Documentation**: [Logistic Regression README](./LogisticRegression/README.md)

3. **Upcoming Models**
    - Additional models such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines will be added, each with its folder and documentation.
