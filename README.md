# Mathematics-Driven Machine Learning

This repository is dedicated to implementing various machine learning models from scratch using Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide educational resources and practical examples for understanding machine learning algorithms at a fundamental level, with a focus on gaining deeper insights into their mathematical foundations and practical usage.

## Repository Structure

Each model is organized into its own folder, which includes:

- **Python Script**: The implementation of the machine learning model.
- **README.md**: A detailed explanation of the model, its mathematical background, and sample outputs.
